# 🌟 OmniCare AI - Unified Help Across Research, Learning & Health
## Democratizing Education & Healthcare in India

## 🎯 The Pitch: Why This Matters

### 💡 The Problem: Access Inequality in India

**Education Crisis:**
- **40% of Indian students** lack access to quality education (UNICEF 2024)
- Private tutors cost ₹500-2000/hour (~$6-24 USD) - unaffordable for 800 million Indians living on <₹150/day
- **260 million students** need personalized learning support
- Rural students have 3x higher dropout rates due to lack of teaching resources
- Competitive exams (JEE, NEET, UPSC) require expensive coaching (₹50,000-200,000/year)

**Healthcare Information Gap:**
- **70% of Indian healthcare** is in urban areas, but 65% of population is rural
- Only **1 doctor per 1,456 people** (WHO recommends 1:1000)
- **63% of health expenses** are out-of-pocket due to lack of guidance
- People don't know when to use:
  - 112 (Emergency) vs 102 (Ambulance) vs 104 (Health Helpline)
  - AIIMS vs PHC vs Private Hospital
  - Ayushman Bharat vs Private Insurance

**Digital Divide:**
- **2.2 billion people globally** have vision impairment (WHO)
- Only **1% of Indian websites** meet basic accessibility standards
- Screen readers struggle with most educational/healthcare content
- Audio alternatives are rare and expensive to produce
