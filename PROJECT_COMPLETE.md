## 📋 What Was Built

### **Track Selected**: 🤝 Agents for Good

### **Problem & Solution**:
- **Problem**: 2.2 billion people with disabilities lack accessible research tools
- **Solution**: AI Multi-Agent System with WCAG compliance and audio support

### **5 Specialized Agents**:
1. 🔍 **Research Agent** - Searches DuckDuckGo + Wikipedia
2. 📝 **Summarizer Agent** - Analyzes and extracts key insights  
3. 📊 **Report Generator** - Creates professional cited reports
4. ♿ **Accessibility Agent** - WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance ⭐
5. 🔊 **Text-to-Speech Agent** - Audio-ready content generation ⭐

## 🎓 Capstone Requirements Met (4/4)

### ✅ 1. Multi-Agent System
- **Sequential agents**: 3 agents in pipeline (Research → Summarize → Report)
- **Agent coordination**: Data flows between agents
- **Task decomposition**: Complex research broken into subtasks

### ✅ 2. Custom Tools
- **Web Search Tool**: DuckDuckGo integration
- **Wikipedia API Tool**: Authoritative information
- **Summarization Tool**: Extractive text analysis
- **Report Generation Tool**: Professional formatting

### ✅ 3. Sessions & Memory
- **SessionService**: State management with disk persistence
- **MemoryBank**: Long-term memory for research history
- **Context Engineering**: Compaction to optimize context size

### ✅ 4. Observability
- **AgentLogger**: File + console logging
- **AgentTracer**: Distributed tracing with unique trace IDs
- **MetricsCollector**: Performance metrics and analytics
