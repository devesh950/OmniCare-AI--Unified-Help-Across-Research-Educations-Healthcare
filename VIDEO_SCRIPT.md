## 🎥 Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: PROBLEM (0:00-0:30)

**Visual:**
- Slide 1: Title "The Problem: Access Inequality"
- Slide 2: Statistics with icons
  - 📚 "260M Indian students lack quality education"
  - 🏥 "Only 1 doctor per 1,456 people in India"
  - ♿ "2.2B people with vision impairment worldwide"
- Slide 3: "Private tutors: ₹50,000-200,000/year" with sad student icon

**Script (30 seconds):**

```
"In India, 260 million students can't access quality education.
Private tutoring costs up to 200,000 rupees a year—unaffordable for most.

Healthcare? Only one doctor per 1,456 people, and 70% of services
are in cities while 65% of the population lives in rural areas.

People don't know when to call 112, when to visit a hospital,
or how to navigate complex medical information.

And for 2.2 billion people with vision impairments worldwide?
Most websites aren't even accessible.

This is the inequality we're solving."
```

### Scene 2: WHY AGENTS? (0:30-1:00)

**Visual:**
- Slide 4: "Why AI Agents?" with brain icon
- Animation: Show 7 agents appearing as connected nodes
- Highlight each agent with icon:
  - 🔬 Research
  - 📊 Summarizer
  - 📄 Report
  - 🎓 Education
  - 🏥 Healthcare
  - ♿ Accessibility
  - 🔊 TTS

**Script (30 seconds):**

```
"Traditional AI uses one model for everything. But we built
SEVEN specialized AI agents that think, decide, and adapt.

The Research Agent finds information. The Summarizer extracts key insights.
The Report Generator structures it professionally.

The Education Tutor adapts to YOUR learning style—visual, auditory,
kinesthetic. It detects subjects automatically and adjusts difficulty.

The Healthcare Navigator assesses urgency. Is this an emergency?
Urgent? Or routine? It guides you to the right care level.

Each agent has UNIQUE expertise. They work together like a team of specialists.
That's the power of multi-agent intelligence."
```

### Scene 3: ARCHITECTURE (1:00-2:00)

**Visual:**
- Screen recording of actual application:
  - Show tab structure
  - Highlight Research tab
  - Show agent workflow animation
- Slide 5: Architecture diagram
  - Show: Research → Summarize → Report → Accessibility → TTS flow
  - Show: Education Agent (standalone)
  - Show: Healthcare Agent (standalone)
  - Show: Observability layer (logging, tracing, metrics)

**Script (60 seconds):**

```
"Here's how it works.

[Show screen] We built a web application with SEVEN tabs.
Each powered by intelligent agents.

[Research tab demo] Type a question—let's say 'Python basics.'

The Research Agent searches the web using DuckDuckGo.
The Summarizer Agent extracts key points.
The Report Generator creates a professional document.
The Accessibility Agent ensures it's WCAG 2.1 compliant.
The TTS Agent adds audio narration.

All in under 3 seconds. [Show Quick Preview section]

[Education tab] Switch to Education. Select Programming.
Ask anything—'Explain loops.' The agent auto-detects the subject,
generates a summary, and adapts to your level.

[Healthcare tab] Healthcare Navigator. Enter symptoms.
'Persistent headache with fever.' The agent assesses urgency,
provides guidance, and shows India-specific resources.

All emergency numbers: 112, 102, 108. Major hospitals: AIIMS, Apollo.
Telemedicine: Practo, e-Sanjeevani.

[Observability tab] Built-in monitoring. See trace IDs linking agent decisions.
Metrics showing performance. Evaluation scores—our Research Agent
scores 99 out of 100 on quality.

This isn't a prototype. It's production-ready with sessions, memory,
and error handling."
```

### Scene 4: DEMO (2:00-2:45)

**Visual:**
- Live demo showing:
  1. Research query completing with auto-navigation
  2. Education tutor showing programming summary
  3. Healthcare navigator with emergency numbers
  4. Accessibility features (alt text, audio)

**Script (45 seconds):**

```
"Watch it in action.

[Research] Search 'Machine learning basics.' Five agents collaborate...
Done. Auto-navigates to Results. Executive Summary—solid blue, high contrast
for accessibility. Full report with citations. Sources listed.

[Education] Programming subject. 'Teach me Python variables.'
Topic summary appears. Basic introduction. Adaptive difficulty.
Scroll down—India resources. Mental health helplines. NPTEL courses.
SWAYAM MOOCs. NSP scholarships. All free.

[Healthcare] 'Severe chest pain.' URGENCY: EMERGENCY.
'Call 112 immediately.' That's potentially life-saving guidance.
For non-emergencies: symptom info, resources, prevention tips.

India-specific: 15+ helplines. Major hospital networks. Online consultation.
Pharmacies. Lab tests. Insurance schemes like Ayushman Bharat.

[Accessibility] Audio narration ready. Screen reader friendly.
Alt text generated. WCAG 2.1 AA compliant.

All free. No API costs. Available 24/7."
